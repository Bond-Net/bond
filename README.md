As our digital footprints increase by the day, safety is becoming more and more difficult to obtain.<br>
With [**BOND**](https://github.com/keybraker/BOND) we try to solve this exact problem, not by adding a third party as a layer of trust, but by giving you the control of  your own security.

>Trust is a difficult thing to gain from an individual -especially a stranger- **and with [**BOND**](https://github.com/keybraker/BOND) you do not have to !**

The biggest convinience that password managers have to deliver is, the ability of _cross-platform logins_. But in order to achieve this functionality traditional password managers ask you to trust them. <br>
With [**BOND**](https://github.com/keybraker/BOND) you never have to trust anyone but also getting the convinience that _cross-platform logins_ deliver !<br>

[**BOND**](https://github.com/keybraker/BOND) can function as a local-device or a decentralized-online password manager - the choice is yours.<br>

Every user who wants to create bonds, has to allocate a set amount of storage and bandwidth on his device in order to connect to the bond-net. The amount of storage he gives, is the amount of storage he has in the bond-net to store his passwords.<br>

1. Locally [**BOND**](https://github.com/keybraker/BOND) creates a key-vault with SHA-256 encryption for which only you have the key.
2. If you want to create bonds, [**BOND**](https://github.com/keybraker/BOND) creates a bond-list with SHA-256 encryption with the same master-key and then fragments  the key-vault and destributs it, the bonds in your bond-list.

>This decentralized approach allows security-of-scale, which means the more bonds you have the safer your data is.<br>
Users can store their data online without any-one entity having control over it. Bonds are created per-user which allows users to create relationships with other [**BOND**](https://github.com/keybraker/BOND) users.

## Functions of the [**BOND**](https://github.com/keybraker/BOND)
1. Password generator with 5-levels  of strength
2. Password manager for as many passwords as you give storage for
3. Bonds created from you with other user

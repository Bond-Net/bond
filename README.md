# BOND 
> The first truly decentralized password manager
As our digital footprints increase by the day, safety is becoming more and more difficult to obtain. 
With **BOND** we try to solve this exact problem, by not adding a layer of trust, but by removing one.
With **BOND** we try to solve this exact problem, not by adding a third party as a layer of trust, but by giving YOU the control of  your own security.

Trust is a difficult thing to gain from an individual -especially a stranger- **and with BOND you do not have to !**

>The biggest convinience that password managers have to deliver is, the ability of _cross-platform logins_. But in order to achieve them you have to trust them. With **BOND** you never have to trust anyone but yourself. **BOND** can function as a local-device password manager or as a decentralized online password manager - the choice is yours.

Every **BOND** who wants to create bonds, has to allocate a set amount of storage and bandwidth on his device in order to connect to the bondNet. Following the amount given to the bondNet, users can store that amount of data to the bondNet themselves. 
Locally **BOND** creates

are the most important stucture of **BOND**, it allows users to create relationships with other **BOND** users.

Users can store their data online without any-one entity having control over it. Bonds are created per-user, which means a user selects the person he wants to create a bond with. 

The more bonds a user has, the more secure they are in the internet. All the data from their computer is encrypted by SHA-256 on device before sent and stored on a bond. 

Every user has a bonds-list, aswell as a key-file, the key-file is always encrypted. Access to it is granted to the one holding the master-key (usb key). The more bond you have the more segments your key-file is split into. This means that increasing the number of active bonds increases your safety on the internet and as only fragments of encryted data are stored across other devices your data is 100% safe.

Every user has to give a set amount of storage from his device and set ammount of bandwidth in order to enter the pool-list.
The amount of storage he gives, is the amount of storage space he has in the pool-list.

## Parts of the project
1. Password generator with 5-levels  of strength
2. Password manager for as many passwords as you give storage for
3. Bonds created from you with other user

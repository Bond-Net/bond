# BOND 
The first truly decentralized password manager<br>
As our digital footprints increase by the day, safety is becoming more and more difficult to obtain. <br>
With **BOND** we try to solve this exact problem, not by adding a third party as a layer of trust, but by giving you the control of  your own security.

>Trust is a difficult thing to gain from an individual -especially a stranger- **and with BOND you do not have to !**

The biggest convinience that password managers have to deliver is, the ability of _cross-platform logins_. But in order to achieve this functionality you have to trust them. With **BOND** you never have to trust anyone but yourself. **BOND** can function as a local-device or a decentralized-online password manager - the choice is yours.<br>

Every user who wants to create bonds, has to allocate a set amount of storage and bandwidth on his device in order to connect to the bondNet. The amount of storage he gives, is the amount of storage he has in the bondNet to store his passwords.<br>

1. Locally **BOND** creates a key-vault with SHA-256 encryption for which only you have the key.
2. Online **BOND** creates a key-vault and a bond-list with SHA-256 encryption for which only you have the key, but destributes the fragmented key-vault to your bonds in your bond-list.

>This decentralized approach allows security-of-scale, which means the more bonds you have the safer your data is.<br>
Users can store their data online without any-one entity having control over it. Bonds are created per-user which allows users to create relationships with other **BOND** users.

Every user has a bonds-list, aswell as a key-vault, the key-vault is always encrypted. Access to it is granted to the one holding the master-key (usb key). The more bonds you have the more segments your key-vault is split into. This means that increasing the number of active bonds increases your safety and as only fragments of encryted data are stored across other devices your data is 100% safe.

Every user has to give a set amount of storage from his device and set ammount of bandwidth in order to enter the pool-list.
The amount of storage he gives, is the amount of storage  he has in the pool-list.

## Functions of the BOND
1. Password generator with 5-levels  of strength
2. Password manager for as many passwords as you give storage for
3. Bonds created from you with other user

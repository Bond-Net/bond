# BOND
As our digital footprints increase by the day, safety is becoming more and more difficult to obtain. With Bond we try to solve this exact problem, by not adding a layer of trust, but by removing one.

Trust is a difficult thing to gain from another one, so why should you trust us ? - **Because you do not have to !**

With BondTM you never have to trust anyone but yourself, we never store or send your data outside of your computer. Everything is stored locally in bond, your personal vault.

The biggest convinience that password managers have to deliver is, the ability of crossplatform logins. For that reason, we created Bond, a decentralized password manager that syncs throughout your devices using bond. Bonds are the most important stucture of BOND, it allows users to create relaitionships with users, from user-pools and add bonds to their accounts.

The more bonds a user has, the more secure they are in the internet. All the data from their computer is encrypted by SHA-256 on device before sent and stored on a bond. 

Every user has a bonds-list, aswell as a key-file, the key-file is always encrypted. Access to it is granted to the one holding the master-key (usb key). The more bond you have the more segments your key-file is split into. This means that increasing the number of active bonds increases your safety on the internet and as only fragments of encryted data are stored across other devices your data is 100% safe.

Every user has to give a set amount of storage from his device and set ammount of bandwidth in order to enter the pool-list.
The amount of storage he gives, is the amount of storage space he has in the pool-list.
